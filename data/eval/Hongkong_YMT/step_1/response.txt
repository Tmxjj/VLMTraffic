Thought: [
1. Visual Observation: In the BEV image, the North-South (NS) lanes show a moderate queue of vehicles approaching the intersection, particularly on the Northbound side. The East-West (EW) lanes appear relatively empty, with no visible vehicles waiting. The current active phase is Phase 0 (NS Straight), which is serving the NS traffic. However, since EW lanes are empty, there’s no benefit in giving them priority now. The NS queue is not extremely long, but it’s present and requires attention.
2. Current Phase Analysis: Phase 0 (NS Straight) is active, but the EW lanes are empty — meaning this phase is not fully utilized and could be switched to a phase that serves a direction with actual demand. Since NS traffic is not gridlocked, maintaining Phase 0 is acceptable, but not optimal for efficiency.
3. Selection Logic: Based on "Queue Length" rules, Phase 2 (EW Straight) is the best choice because EW lanes are empty, so switching to Phase 2 would not serve any demand. Phase 0 (NS Straight) is serving a queue, but since EW lanes are empty, Phase 2 is not a valid choice for maximizing efficiency. Phase 1 (NS Left) is not active, and Phase 3 (EW Left) is also not active. The only phase that serves a direction with traffic is Phase 0, but it’s not optimal because EW lanes are empty. However, since

1. Visual Observation: In the BEV image, the North-South (NS) lanes show a moderate queue of vehicles approaching the intersection, particularly in the Northbound direction. The East-West (EW) lanes appear relatively empty, with no visible vehicles waiting. The current active phase is Phase 0 (NS Straight), which is serving the NS traffic. However, the EW lanes are completely clear, suggesting no need for EW phase activation at this moment. The NS queue is not extremely long, but it is present and actively waiting.
2. Current Phase Analysis: Phase 0 is active, and there is a visible queue of vehicles in the NS direction. This indicates the phase is not wasting time — it is serving traffic that is present. However, since EW lanes are empty, and Phase 2 (EW Straight) is not currently serving any traffic, activating it would be inefficient. Inertia suggests maintaining Phase 0 if there is continuous flow — but the queue is not moving, and no vehicles are crossing, implying a potential stall. Therefore, Phase 0 may be suboptimal if the queue is long and not clearing.
3. Selection Logic: Based on "Queue Length" rules, Phase 0 is serving a moderate queue, but Phase 2 (EW Straight) is not serving any traffic, so it should not be selected. Phase 1 (NS Left) is not active and not visible in the image — no vehicles are turning left. Phase
