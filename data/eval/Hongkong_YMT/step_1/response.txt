Thought: [
1. Visual Observation: In the BEV image, the North-South (NS) lanes show a moderate queue of vehicles approaching the stop line, particularly in the Northbound direction. The East-West (EW) lanes appear largely empty, with no visible vehicles approaching the stop line. The current active phase is Phase 0 (NS Straight), which is serving the NS lanes. However, the EW lanes are idle, indicating wasted green time.
2. Current Phase Analysis: Phase 0 is active, but the EW lanes are empty — meaning the signal is not serving any demand. This violates the “Green Time Utilization” rule and indicates inefficiency.
3. Selection Logic: Based on “Queue Length” rules, Phase 2 (EW Straight) should be selected because the EW lanes are empty and thus not serving any traffic, while NS lanes have a queue — but since EW lanes are idle, it’s better to serve them to avoid wasted green time. However, since Phase 0 is serving NS and NS has a queue, we should consider if Phase 0 is still effective. But since EW lanes are empty, and Phase 0 is not serving them, Phase 2 (EW Straight) is more efficient to activate next to utilize green time productively.
