1. Visual Observation: In the BEV image, the North-South (NS) lanes show a moderate queue of vehicles approaching the intersection, particularly on the Northbound side. The East-West (EW) lanes appear relatively empty, with no visible vehicles waiting at the stop lines. The current active phase is Phase 0 (NS Straight), which is serving the NS direction. However, since EW lanes are empty, there is no benefit to keeping Phase 0 active — it’s not utilizing green time effectively.
2. Current Phase Analysis: Phase 0 is not effective because the EW lanes are empty and the NS direction, while having a queue, is not the only or most congested direction. Since Phase 0 is not serving any empty lanes, and the EW lanes are clear, it is wasting green time and not maximizing throughput.
3. Selection Logic: Based on "Queue Length" rules, Phase 2 (EW Straight) is the best choice because the EW lanes are empty, and there is no queue to serve — so this phase would not be effective. However, Phase 0 is also not serving any empty lanes, so we must consider the next best option. Since the NS direction has a queue, Phase 0 should be kept — but only if there is a continuous flow. However, the NS queue is not large enough to justify extending Phase 0. Therefore, the best next phase is Phase 2, as it serves the empty lanes and avoids wasting green time. But wait — Phase 2 is EW Straight, which has no cars. So Phase 1 (NS Left) might be better if there’s a left-turn queue. But there is no visible left-turn queue. So Phase 0 should be maintained if there’s flow. But the NS queue is moderate, not heavy. Therefore, Phase 0 should be kept — but the problem says “do not select a phase if its corresponding lanes are empty.” Phase 0 is not empty — it has a queue. So Phase 0 is valid. But Phase 2 is empty — so it should not be selected. So Phase 0 is the best choice — because it is serving a queue and is not empty. Phase 1 (NS Left) — no visible left-turn queue. Phase 3 (EW Left) — no visible left-turn queue. So Phase 0 is the only one serving a queue. Therefore, Phase 0 is the best choice.
